Product reviews are becoming more important with the evolution of online shopping from traditional brick and mortar retail stores. Consumers are now posting reviews directly on the product page in real time. With vast amount of consumer reviews, this creates an opportunity to see how the market reacts to a specific product.
I will be attempting to see if I can predict the sentiment of a product review using machine learning tools, particularly the Support Vector Machine.

The dataset I will be using is from www.kaggle.com.

I have also provided the direct link below if you wish to view the dataset I used to build my model:

This project was completed using Jupyter Notebook and Python with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn.

This was my first project using Python with no prior programming knowledge, and I look forward to contributing to the community!
